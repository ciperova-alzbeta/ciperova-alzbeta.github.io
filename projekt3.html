          Used tissues function as reminders of temporality — traces of once
          intense emotions translated into a form resembling scientific or
          archival documentation. The multimedia installation invites the viewer
          to experience tears as a memory of a feeling that once prevailed in
          the mind with great intensity, yet in reality has - like the tears
          theymselves - gradually faded.

              The work consists of used tissues suspended on threads in a grid
              formation, each containing dried tears. Opposite them hangs a
              handmade notebook, functioning as a personal archive. The viewer
              can leaf through it’s pages and match each tissue to a
              corresponding entry through a simple structural image. Each page
              reveals the reason that led to tears at that moment, transforming
              private emotional episodes into a catalogued record.

              Alongside the dried tissues, a textile print presents a
              photographic image of a tissue captured while the outline of the
              tears was still visible - a reminder of the raw, immediate state
              of emotion. Through it’s translation into textile, this rawness
              becomes softened, mirroring the process of tears drying over time.
              This act of material transformation forms the healing dimension of
              the work: emotional intensity is not erased, but gently processed
              and recontextualized.

              The installation is completed by a video documenting the gradual
              drying of tears, emphasizing duration, vulnerability, and the
              quiet transformation from immediacy to memory. Together, the
              elements create a contemplative space where emotion is preserved
              not in its urgency, but in its aftermath - as evidence of having
              been felt.
